# OpenEVdrive
Open-source &amp; Open-hardware EV drive project. EV drive consist of powerfull electric motor, electronic driver and transmission.

# Targets
Aim of this project is define, design and prototype 350kW EV drive.

## Expected features
All features expect vehicle with standard rims and tires of overall size 650mm and average aerodynamic drag coeficient approx. 0.325 sq. metters (3.5 sq. ft.). All requirements has been calculated using Reuirements calculations.xlsx.
Features are:
- Accelerate from 0 to 100km/h under 5s for vehicle of weight 1.8t.
- Accelerate from 0 to 100km/h under 6.5s for vehicle of weight 2.4t.
- theoretical max. speed on flat road more than 350km/h.
- max. speed 190km/h on 14% slope (8°) for vehicle of weight 1.8t.
- max. speed 155km/h on 14% slope (8°) for vehicle of weight 2.4t.
